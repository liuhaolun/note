# Introduction
- Low level robotics techonology has a widespread application in educational and entertaining market. 
- %% The interaction between teenagers and robot is considered to be beneficial for their intellectual groth. As a consequence, attracting parents... %%
- The interaction between teenagers or children and robots has been shown to enhance their intellectual development, particularly language learning and computational skills. (cite 2) As a result, parents are increasingly interested in implementing robots for educational purposes.
这里假设已经谈完市场的部分，接下来介绍？
- Safety guarantees and less maintenances are rendered necessary by the operating environment of these applications. Upon fulfillment of these requirements has effectively increases the difficulties in designing of robots for educational and entertaining purposes, it shall be determined which is compared to be more complicated than another. 
分别谈论
%% - The rapid development and fast trender in toys industry has allows for manufactures that have the capabilitie to offer low-cost parts to (gain great benefits). e.g., (哪个玩具商->LEGO) （引用）（自动机器）earned ... money %%
- The rapid development and emerging trends in the toy industry have created significant opportunities for manufacturers with low-cost production capabilities to achieve substantial market gains. For instance, LEGO, through its implementation of robotics techniques in its toys, has generated considerable revenue streams during the past decade. (cite 1)
%%  (Though) professional student in 手术 and robot operating can get into contact with the most advancing techniques, it is hard to combine traditional K12 education with robotics, which has the most share in the educational market. Positive example from LEGO, cite article 1 %%
- Although college students who are in medical and surgical marjors can access cutting-edge robotic technologies in their professional training, integrating robotics into conventional K-12 education remains challenging. Essentially, K-12 education holds a significant share of the educational technology market. LEGO provides a notable exception, successfully bridging this gap through their educational robotics toy platforms. (cite 1)

### Ease of use
结论：在co-robot方面的共性，同样发展方向，但educational具有更多限制->学校时间、教室内？
Domestic environments imply that the operator or co-operator of the robot has minimal or no experience and professional skill. Which suggest that the robot "has to" operate it by itself, require a high-standard software control system. The hardware mimicry technique is poor at our time, thus the robot is not inherently attracting like a pet, so the robot has to perform very well to attract attention of a young baby or teenager without hurting them. The cutting-edge techniques in robotics cannot guarantee "smooth" and "vivid" movement. And the AI is required in it. Toy Manufacturers are experts in hardware, they cannot afford high-cost investment in AI, thus they have to collaborate with leading AI companies. Still, the smooth and vivid control is unsolved problem, one of the developing technique is bio-inspired movement control, which aims to mock “zoomorphic or humanoid forms”. Basically, it assumed that a zoomorphic robot can have better effect in building connection with children without utilizing more complex algorithm. Researchers have revealed that solely changing the appearance of zoomorphic robot can have significant positive impact. (cite3)
上面是entertain的分析，怎样对应着进行education分析。
Robotics technologies are inherently attracting for K-12 students; however, these technologies are demonstrated in museums and showrooms, and are intensively expensive which prevented them from deeply involved to class. The requirement for attracting student is moderated due to class environment, there's no disturbance and students are willing to utilize robotics techonologies to asist them in STEM. These robots may serve as chemists in chemistry class and prevent student from wrong procedures, or in biology class to help control microscopes. These applications donot require "smooth" movement patterns, however, it requires "precise" and "repeatable" movement and sensible to environment. It is expected to perform better than teacher, thus student can benefit from it. Which come to another cutting-edge technology in Robotics, Mechatronics, where robot itself has to develop with chemical and physical and biological sensors.
### Proven Effectiveness
这才发现，在上文写过了
### Cost Effectiveness
思路是提出：1.和购买一部手机的费用 2.平均学校实验设施预算 3.机器人成本 4.传感器成本

- Cost can directly affect the willing for customers to purchase a robot. If we consider the 20% richest people in the US as potential customers. The average price they spend in a phone is 790$. It is appropriate to suppose that they would spend about same money to buy a robot for their children, especially if treating it as educational investment. In typical situation of small alternative high school (with about 100 students), science funds are around 5000 dollars per 6~8 years, which has to be shared to buy other equipments. Source from EDFIN (Educational Finance Statistics Center) suggest that for each pupil in the US, the government spend less than 100 dollars for lab in average from 2020 to 2023, to mention, typical class in US middle school has 10~20 pupils. Situation in school is severe. PBS news claimed that 70% of science teachers in the US does not have adequate funding and have to spend their own money.

小型替代高中（100学生），science funds around 5000 dollars.  shared with other equipments. will be used for years
resource EDFIN -> less than 100$ dollar for lab for each pupil in average in the US
- The limited budget is insufficient for buying "useful" robot. Most 6-axis robot arm offers nothing exclusive, some of this robot arms serves in playing chess with kid, at a price of 300$. However, they are not useful in entertaining. An common setup of entertaining robot should have 4 legs, a laser sensor, and embedded computer. The cost of a robot dog is non less than 1400 dollars, which is about 2 time 790 dollars. Due to the high requirementsin robots' application in laboratory use, the price can be comparable to those used for industry purposes, which is really high. And sensor cost take a big portion of it, sensor cost is unable to reduced by changing the component to light-weight lab-fit style. 
### User Acceptance

Whether for entertaining or educational approaches, robotic is a novel stuff. It is not only people have to be curiosity to adapt it, but itself is unmature.
User Acceptance is based on the true useful of this, which has different basic principle compare to why industry adapt robot. Only few people are frenzy in technics, even for these people, they need to find a need before integrate it into their life. One of the need lies in "productivity", if sth. is considered boosting productivity, it will be purchased, even it's main use is for entertainment, e.g. parents buy their children smartphone for "communication", but everyone know they would use it to play games. Robot is the same, and it has to be compared with phone, can it attract children while they have the phone, since robot is not like pet, and must be used in-home. If robot combined with AI can offer meaningful connection which is deadly lack in modern lifestyle of children, it can definitely attract children. 

Robots are treated as novel stuff in schools, exhibited in showrooms as part of fixed equipment, but never or seldomly used. Improving user acceptance is not achievable by government promoting, robot itself has to have meaningful use, i.e. it is not to work solely, but has to be integrated in chemistry or physical experiments. And the only meaningful way to integrate robot into experiment is to use it as precise operator, to instead traditional ways tha teacher showcase in front of the classroom. Still, the techinique is immature and requires further improvements. 


在co-robot方面的共性，同样发展方向，但educational具有更多限制->学校时间、教室内？

Challenges in entertaining and educational applications lies in basically same as the development of current robotic, that is better control system, and low-cost sensors. Definitely it is too early to talk about why customers donot accept or adopt to it at the early age of entertaining and educational robotics. Current robotics with really limited features are simple sth. that looks fancy and tech-sense, not sth usable and functional, while all of those mature things are functional. The too professional is another negative, no one find good way to use robot in general ways, as assistant of mans. Gimbal is a positive example, it use the robotic control techniques, and serves to help people recording videos. Robot need to be more advanced and find more use to be useful and widespread used. However, educational usage not only have higher requirement, hard budget limit, and it has a limit in usage time. That it is used in school time in classroom, which further make it harder to find its place for use. I claimed that educational robotic is more difficult.
