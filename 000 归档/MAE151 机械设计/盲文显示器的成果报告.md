We start from the multiple layers of Flexible Printed Circuit, each layer is very thin, about 49micrometer, so 5 layers is only 250micrometers, 1 forth of a milimeter. 
The vias can connect circuit on different layers, we choose to use local vias, that is, we do not lead the coils to the edge of the circuit board, instead, we drill vertical vias to connect all 5 layers to the bottom.
The bottom is connected to a FR4-based board, a hard PrintedCircuitBoard. So the 分工 is, Flexible board as coils to generate driving torque, and FR4 board has control circuit printed and chips soldered on it.

The core of the device is constructed using a **multi-layered Flexible Printed Circuit (FPC)**, where each individual layer has an ultra-thin profile of approximately **49 micrometers (µm)**. When stacked, **five layers** amount to a total thickness of **250 µm (0.25 mm)**, making the structure highly compact

To ensure efficient electrical connectivity across the layers, **localized micro-vias** are implemented instead of conventional edge routing. These **vertical holes** directly connect all five FPC layers to the **bottommost layer**, allow us to change the amount of layers in stack.

The flexible assembly is then integrated with a **rigid FR4-based Printed Circuit Board (PCB)**, - The **FPC ** functions as a **high-density coil array**, generating the required **driving torque** .
- The **FR4 PCB** hosts the **control circuits** and chips are soldered on its bottom surface.**

For each small piece of plate, shown in the right side, there are 2 magnets installed on it. We call it magnet Alpha and Beta for now.
Obviously, a plate is associated with either Pair (1,3) or Pair(2,4). In each pair, there are 4 coils in total.

We want to switch the plate in its 4 stages, the gap between the stage is 12 degree, so the plate does not exist 象限1,3 (where coil pair 1,3 locates) and do not interfere with the plate installed on 象限2,4.
The display dot has small needle on top, so it can follow the ups and downs on the profile of plates.
Each stage 由 a magnet and a coild control, for example, in stage 1, magnet alpha is attracted by coil A in 象限3.
~~~
The device employs a **four-stage switching**, where each stage is angularly offset by **12 degrees** to ensure The plate do not exist ** Quadrants 2 and 4** (where **Coil Pair 2,4** is located). to prevent interference with another plate mounted in **Quadrants 1 and 3**.

- A **display dot** has a **small-needle** touching on the plates upper surface, allowing the dot to **track the contour** of the plates by following their **vertical displacement profile**.

Each stage is independently controlled by a ** magnet-coil pair**, enabling selective actuation. For example:
- In **Stage 1**, **Magnet Alpha** is  attracted by **Coil A** (positioned in **Quadrant 3**), inducing controlled motion.

In our setup, the **plates**—even though they're mechanical parts—are **mounted directly on the circuit board**.

The **FR4 PCB** has **copper pins** that securely hold everything in place. By attaching the plates to the PCB, we **reduce the number of separate parts** that need machining, making assembly simpler.

So, from **bottom to top**, the layers are:

1. **FR4 PCB** (the rigid base)
2. **Stacked FPC** (the flexible circuit)
3. **Plate 1 & Plate 2** (mounted at the **same height**, since they don’t interfere)
4. **Copper pins** (they lock the plates in place but leave a **small vertical gap**, allowing the plates to **rotate freely**)

Each **unit** controls **4 display dots**—but to actually **display a character**, we need at least **6 dots that is 2 units** working together.

We're using a **24-channel PWM driver chip** – this single chip can actually control **three complete units** simultaneously. Now here's the clever part:

Even though each coil has **two terminals**, we've wired one side directly to **common ground**. This means each unit only needs **four control signals** – making the whole system much simpler to manage.

If we rearrange the circuit on a **4-layer PCB design**, we'll been able to mount these driver chips **directly underneath each unit** – no extended board needed. This gives us a clean, compact layout where everything fits together.
We can network **many driver chips together**, all controlled by a central controller like arduino. This way, we can expand the system to control dozens of units while keeping perfect timing across the entire array.
