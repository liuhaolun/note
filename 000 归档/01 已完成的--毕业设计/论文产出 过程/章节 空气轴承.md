**Fabrication of the Custom-designed Air Bearing Components**

The air bearing components employed in the experimental setup was custom-designed and fabricated. The manufacturing process was carefully controlled to ensure smooth surface of the pad slider bearing.
Optical glass with a low surface roughness （typically Ra<0.2 μm) was utilized as the mold.
An epoxy resin was employed to form the pad surface, which was subsequently drilled at the center to accommodate porous material infiltration. Additionally, side holes were drilled to serve as air inlets.
A ceramic ball was positioned on top of the assembly and connected to a hex-headed bolt, serves as the pivot point.

Compressed air is inlet into the porous material is decelerated and. Part of the kinetic energy is converted into heat, resulting in a temperature rise of the bearing. To prevent thermal expansion caused by the temperature increase, the porous material is fabricated using gypsum with Zerodur properties. Additionally, agate is employed for the housing due to its hardness and minimal deformation tendency. The pad surface is constructed from epoxy resin (Shore 85), molded on optical glass plate. Tungsten steel needles are used to engrave 30 μm × 100 μm grooves on the surface. The outlet air is guided through cross grooves to the outer circular grooves. Since the outer grooves are closer to the bearing edge, the formation of a de Laval nozzle is avoided. Consequently, supersonic regions are prevented, ensuring that the bearing consistently provides thrust rather than a pull force.

**Self-Alignment Mechanism**
【未完成推导】**Self-Stabilization of Vertical Gap**
When the air inlet pressure was maintained at 0.7 MPa with only the central throat and no engraved air-guiding grooves on the epoxy resin surface, a high-pitched noise was observed during forcing the bearing to separate vertically. This phenomenon was attributed to constant airflow rate while the gap increased, leading to localized pressure drops. Consequently, a de Laval nozzle effect was induced, generating supersonic flow conditions in certain regions.
Since the pad is axisymmetric, the flow can be reasonably assumed to be two-dimensional for simplification purposes. The pressure around the throat is defined as **P₀**, while beyond the pad radius, the pressure equals the ambient pressure **Pₐ**. (It should be noted that the pad surface is flat and does not feature the converging-diverging geometry of a de Laval nozzle.)

As illustrated in the schematic, if the cumulative pull force generated in the regions where �<��P<Pa​ exceeds the thrust force produced in the regions where �>��P>Pa​, a net suction force will be generated by the bearing.

It is assumed that the gap have a uniform height \( h \), and the airflow exhibits a purely radial velocity. The velocity profile is considered uniform, and air viscosity is neglected in the analysis.

Moller【引用论文】提到，在supersonic region中p和p0的关系可以通过关系式表达为：。并且可知从超声区域到次声区域的normal shock发生的位置r，其关系可以表达为：。因此，假设inlet air flow rate不变，则pull air bearing时，导致gap height h增加，r的值增大，normal shock的发生位置向外移动，产生更大的低压区域；同理，增加中心孔径，则ri增加、r的值也增加，产生的低压区域总面积比中心孔径增加前更大。在仅有中心孔的状态下，Pressure distribution是半径向外方向先降再增，我们希望Pressure的曲线的二阶变化减少。并且在equipment setup中，不需要air bearing提供hanging force。因此，circular and cross-line grooves被utilzed来改变pressure distribution.
Moller [citation] mentioned the equation to express the relationship between p and p0​ in the supersonic region. Additionally, the position r of the normal shock transition from the supersonic to the subsonic region is determined by a corresponding relation. Under the assumption of a constant inlet air mass rate, an increase in the gap height h of the air bearing leads to an increase in r. Consequently, the normal shock shifts outward, generating a larger low-pressure region. Similarly, enlarging the central hole increases both ri and r, resulting in a greater total area of the low-pressure region compared to the original configuration. The pressure distribution initially decreases and then increases radially outward [fig]. To minimize the second-order variation in the pressure-radius relationship. Furthermore, the experimental setup does not require the air bearing to provide a hanging force. As a result, Circular and cross-line grooves are employed to regulate the pressure distribution.

The PMMA raw pad (φ20mm in diameter × 6mm in height) was secured within the curing fixture (a 3d-printed part using nylon PA12 material), where thin-wall deformation generated clamping force to prevent displacement of the raw pad. A 0.25mm-thick copper sheet was placed on the optical glass plate. The curing fixture was adjusted until its three bolts contacted the glass surface. Epoxy resin was mixed and applied onto the bottom surface of the raw pad. Mold release wax was coated on the optical glass plate before the curing fixture was pressed onto it. After 48 hours of curing 【Fig. 2.3】, the pad was removed, revealing a highly flat epoxy surface. The pad was then placed epoxy-side down onto scribing fixtures. Furthermore, a central hole (φ2mm) was drilled along the longitudinal centerline. A side hole (φ2mm) was drilled to connect with the central hole, and it's 【用its代指it的某样。it's是it is的简拼】entry (5mm deep) was enlarged to φ2.90mm in diameter. A PU tube (3mm outer diameter, 2mm inner diameter) was secured into the lateral hole using UV glue. A φ2mm solid shaft was inserted into the side hole. Gypsum paste (gypsum powder:water = 1:1.05) was poured into the central hole. After curing, a hemispherical cavity was milled using a φ4.5mm ball-end driller. A φ4.5mm ceramic ball was secured into this cavity using glue. The ceramic ball was connected to a PEEK M5 hex socket bolt. The bolt's inscribed circle diameter (4.020~4.095mm) permitted rotational freedom of the ceramic sphere upon contact. This enabled tilting of the air bearing to align the epoxy surface with the optical glass plate (attached to the bottom plate's bottom).

Due to the unknown inlet flow rate, air permeability of the gypsum, and equivalent porous layer thickness, dynamic analysis could not be performed. Poiseuille's law describes laminar flow through channel between two parallel square plates as [formula]. The pressure boundary conditions were defined by the inlet pressure (0.171325 MPa) and ambient pressure (0.101325 MPa). A weighted Laplacian matrix was constructed using Poisson’s equation [formula] to describe the equilibrium relationship of pressure distribution under the given flow coefficient. The gap height is higher at the grooves and remains constant in other locations. Additionally, Dirichlet boundary conditions were applied. The pressure distribution was computed using SciPy’s sparse linear algebra (scipy.sparse.linalg) tool. The resulting pressure profile along the centerline section is presented in [figure].

对pressure distribution进行积分（不包括inlet pressure）则可以得到升力和高度的关系。应注意的是，这只是单个轴承的升力，共有三个轴承参与支撑以形成稳定支撑。考虑到实验条件包括最大Z方向力不超过2N，可以认为空气轴承发生的压缩最大不超过10μm。弹簧弹性系数在16.3N/mm即0.163N/10μm, 初始加载超过6N，且空气轴承和弹簧同样摆放在等边三角形的三个顶点，其外切圆直径更大，因此认为空气轴承的tilting stiffness超过弹簧的tilting stiffness。由于弹簧的tilting stiffness小于电感测微仪的tilting stiffness，且后者的伸长量示数在实验中不变（变化小于1μm）。假定其形变为1μm，经过计算发现其tilting angle < 1/180度，简化为几何上不发生tilting，然而仍然认识到tilting stiffness导致了contact力，且这个力是friction的原因。

The pressure distribution was integrated (excluding the inlet section) to obtain the relationship between lift force and height, shown in [FIG]. It should be noted that this represents the lift force of a single bearing, while three bearings provide stable support to the plate. Given the experimental conditions, where the maximum vertical force did not exceed 2N, the maximum compression of the air bearings was estimated to be less than 10[微米]. The spring stiffness was 16.3 N/mm (0.163 N/10 μm), and the initial preload exceeded 6 N. The air bearings and springs were uniformly distributed at three points on a circle. Consequently, the tilting stiffness of the air bearings was assumed to exceed that of the springs. Furthermore, the tilting stiffness of the springs was lower than that of the inductive displacement sensors. During experiments, the readings of the inductive displacement sensors remained constant (variation <1微米). Assuming a deformation of 1 μm and 3 time the tilting stiffness than that of the spring, the resulting tilting angle was calculated to be less than 1/180 degrees. The system was treated as geometrically rigid against tilting. However, it was acknowledged that minimal tilting, together with large tilting stiffness, still introduced contact forces, which were identified as the source of friction.
