I relate to your situation, currently I am feeling pressure and kinda don't have contact with my system for a while. Sorry for I actually don't use and familiar to terms in Plurality. I also have ADHD, but not very common loss objects but usually loss many thought, I symphasize with your ADHD situation.
From the post, I understand your situation as follow.
- take Depakote from nov. 2020 to aug. 2024, not a long term. acted mean, which is really common.
- During medicine, feel more plural and more often age regress. In my opinion, if that happened before nov. 2020, then it is not unexpected. As my own experience, if I think less and receive less information, I would experience more.
- younger selves still inside but very internal, no contact or communication that can confirm you they still are. I can imagine it is not like common feeling everyone have on their plural system, but a more like: because my lifestyle has some change, it although continues but unstoppable become faint.
- PMS ADHD undiagnosed autistic, not Bipolar. In these, ADHD has some significant affects on your life, but for other parts, as they have not ruin your life yet diagnosed, at least you've coped against them very well. Many people lived their whole life with undiagnosed disease, many considered to go diagnose their disease, and many feel uncertain about whether a doctor could or not give effective result. It is a good choice to minimize the consideration, just trust that you don't have a lot mental illness.
Although I don't have experience of lessened of these issues. I do have two experience that might be useful.
1. These experiences (of plural and age regress) won't fade off, they are not reset, and even after a long time (like when finally identified the wrong parts in lifestyle), they still are.
2. anciety on having undiagnosed disease can be eliminate like any other compulsive behavior, a simple approach is to build a reward and relate system, to say out "great, I have done it well, I am not Bipolar"

I am not sure whether I meet your points, but even a useless or unrelated reply is better then waiting for nothing as I think.


### 重写AI
I can relate to your situation, as I'm also experiencing pressure and have temporarily lost contact with my system. I apologize for not using formal terms, because I'm not familiar with plurality terminology. I share some similar experiences, especially ADHD. Though I don't typically misplace objects, I often lose track of my thoughts, so I understand your ADHD challenges.

**From what I understand about your situation:**

* took Depakote from Nov. 2020 to Aug. 2024, which isn't a very long period. The medication caused some personality changes, which is also quite common and no need to worry about it, for its not harmful and understanding from other family members.
* During medication, experienced increased plurality and age regression. Based on my experience, if these experience occurred before Nov. 2020, even unusual, then the increases are not unexpected. I've noticed that when I process less information and think less actively, I tend to experience more of these phenomena.
* Your younger selves are still present but deeply internal, with no clear communication to confirm their existence. This isn't necessarily the typical experience within plural systems, but rather seems related to lifestyle changes that have gradually affected your connection with them. Like a sense of powerless coping with the process of faint of them, if this sense occured, then its incorrect because they are not going faint but going deeper.
* Regarding your conditions: You have ADHD, (probably) undiagnosed autism, and PMS, but not Bipolar Disorder. While ADHD significantly impacts your life, you've managed to cope well with the other conditions despite lacking formal diagnoses. Many people live with undiagnosed conditions, and it's perfectly valid to be uncertain about seeking professional diagnosis. For simplification purposes, these "undiagnoseds" should be considered not exist.

**Based on my experiences, I can share two insights:**

1. These experiences of plurality and age regression won't simply disappear. They would echo. The system isn't reset, and even after extended periods, they remain part of who you are. They may become more accessible once you identify and address lifestyle factors that affect them.
2. Anxiety about undiagnosed conditions can be managed like other compulsive behaviors. Try building a reward-n-relate system and positive self-talk, such as acknowledging "I'm doing well, and I'm not Bipolar" when you do well even in some stuff not considered related to Bipolar.

I hope these thoughts are helpful, as I believe any supportive response is better than no response at all.

### Re:
Perhaps it was a good lifestyle change. I am trying to be less stressed. I am trying to be less self critical. I think maybe they dissolved into more like Parts instead of facets or alters. I think it helps I’ve been trying to read an IFS book. I can still identify their names and everything but yeah like I said they went further in the background. I don’t become them necessarily but they still effect things. Like you said maybe they went deeper.

Also I am unable to afford a diagnosis but it has helped me to identify that I am autistic and it has helped to unmask.
