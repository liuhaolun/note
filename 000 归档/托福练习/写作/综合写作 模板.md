Firstly, the reading argues that hosting a major sporting event significantly boosts tourism, which in turn benefits the local economy. Popular events draw large numbers of visitors willing to spend money on food and entertainment. However, the lecturer refutes this by highlighting that not all host cities experience an increase in tourism economy. She cites examples of host cities that have seen limited financial gains, noting that these tourists were just replacing other tourists attracted by the city itself, not by the event. 80词完全足够。
