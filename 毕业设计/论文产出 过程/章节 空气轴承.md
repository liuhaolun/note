**Fabrication of the Custom-designed Air Bearing Components**

The air bearing components employed in the experimental setup was custom-designed and fabricated. The manufacturing process was carefully controlled to ensure smooth surface of the pad slider bearing.
Optical glass with a low surface roughness （typically Ra<0.2 μm) was utilized as the mold.
An epoxy resin was employed to form the pad surface, which was subsequently drilled at the center to accommodate porous material infiltration. Additionally, side holes were drilled to serve as air inlets.
A ceramic ball was positioned on top of the assembly and connected to a hex-headed bolt, serves as the pivot point.

Compressed air is inlet into the porous material is decelerated and. Part of the kinetic energy is converted into heat, resulting in a temperature rise of the bearing. To prevent thermal expansion caused by the temperature increase, the porous material is fabricated using gypsum with Zerodur properties. Additionally, agate is employed for the housing due to its hardness and minimal deformation tendency. The pad surface is constructed from epoxy resin (Shore 85), molded on optical glass plate. Tungsten steel needles are used to engrave 30 μm × 100 μm grooves on the surface. The outlet air is guided through cross grooves to the outer circular grooves. Since the outer grooves are closer to the bearing edge, the formation of a de Laval nozzle is avoided. Consequently, supersonic regions are prevented, ensuring that the bearing consistently provides thrust rather than a pull force.

**Self-Alignment Mechanism**
**Self-Stabilization of Vertical Gap**
When the air inlet pressure was maintained at 0.7 MPa with only the central throat and no engraved air-guiding grooves on the epoxy resin surface, a high-pitched noise was observed during forcing the bearing to separate vertically. This phenomenon was attributed to constant airflow rate while the gap increased, leading to localized pressure drops. Consequently, a de Laval nozzle effect was induced, generating supersonic flow conditions in certain regions.
Since the pad is axisymmetric, the flow can be reasonably assumed to be two-dimensional for simplification purposes. The pressure around the throat is defined as **P₀**, while beyond the pad radius, the pressure equals the ambient pressure **Pₐ**. (It should be noted that the pad surface is flat and does not feature the converging-diverging geometry of a de Laval nozzle.)

As illustrated in the schematic, if the cumulative pull force generated in the regions where �<��P<Pa​ exceeds the thrust force produced in the regions where �>��P>Pa​, a net suction force will be generated by the bearing.

It is assumed that the gap have a uniform height \( h \), and the airflow exhibits a purely radial velocity. The velocity profile is considered uniform, and air viscosity is neglected in the analysis.
