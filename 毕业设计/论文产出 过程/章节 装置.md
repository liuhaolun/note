The experimental setup was divided into two parts. The upper part was installed with a peg, while the lower part was installed with a hole. The objective of the assembly task was to align the axes of the peg and the hole collinearly. Under ideal conditions without disturbances, the best achievable assembly performance was theoretically obtained when the axes were aligned. Further aspects, such as rotating the peg or hole along the yaw axis, or introducing pitch or roll oscillations during insertion, were not considered in this study.

The upper and lower parts of the device were installed separately. Although alignment was performed, a fixed angular misalignment (θ₀ in the roll axis and φ₀ in the pitch axis) remained between their axes.  
Additionally, each uninstallation and reinstallation of the shaft introduced slight variations in the shaft’s alignment relative to the upper part’s axis. Through repeated disassembly and reassembly of the upper part, it was confirmed that this angular deviation consistently remained below 2°.

The upper part was driven by a Z-axis motorized stage (SURUGA SEIKI) with a nominal repeatability of 0.2 μm. Since the step size used in the experiment (10 μm) was significantly larger than this value, positioning errors could be effectively neglected. Consequently, the stage’s motion was assumed to be precise.

Similarly, the 2-axis goniometer stage driving the lower part was also considered precise, providing controlled tilt [\theta_1, \varphi_1] in the roll and pitch axes to Plate (4). It was assumed that the Z-axis force sensor and wave spring (since guide pins absorbed non-axial forces) experienced no uneven compression. Thus, Plate (2) was treated as collinearly aligned with Plate (4).

The gas film generated by the air bearing exhibited non-uniform thickness. However, Plates (1) and (2) were approximated as axially collinear, as calculations indicated that thickness variations had negligible influence. A detailed analysis of the air bearing’s effects is presented in the following subsection.

Under ideal conditions, the spring should undergo only axial compression without buckling and provide linear force feedback. The force-displacement curve should exhibit linearity and reversibility, meaning the unloading curve should coincide with the loading curve.  

The linearity of the coil spring was found to be insufficient. It was observed that the coil spring failed to provide linear force feedback immediately upon contact between the shaft and the hole. However, as the Z-axis displacement reached 230 μm, the force feedback gradually approached linearity. 

To address this issue, EPP foam was tested as an alternative. Although it exhibited higher stiffness and linear force feedback upon initial contact, hysteresis was observed during unloading due to delayed air reabsorption into the foam's cellular structure.  

To eliminate the influence of internal voids in foamed materials, TPU-based 3D-printed pads with different infill patterns were fabricated, including grid, gyroid, and Voronoi structures. The Voronoi infill was generated by randomly distributing points within a uniform grid based on a Gaussian distribution, followed by connecting these points. However, all TPU-printed pads (20 mm × 20 mm × 30 mm) exhibited insufficient stiffness for practical use.  

Solid elastomers were not considered due to their inherent nonlinear force-displacement behavior.

A correlation was observed between higher stiffness, resistance to buckling under axial loading, and linear force-displacement behavior. Consequently, three spring types—plunger springs, rectangular springs, and wave springs—were experimentally evaluated.

The wave springs and rectangular springs demonstrated superior force feedback characteristics. Based on these findings, the wave spring was selected as the final solution.
