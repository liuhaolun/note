The small clearance between the shaft and hole necessitated carefully cocerns on geometry tolerances during geometric modeling. Cylindricity of the shaft attributes to three factors: the straightness of the shaft axis, radius variations along the axial direction, and radius variations at different polar angles.  

We particularly focused to whether the radius variations exhibited preferential deformation directions, that is, if the cross-sectional profile approximated an elliptical shape.

If the center offset accumulates consistently in one direction, indicating an inclined axis, angular compensation becomes necessary during alignment procedures. The offset angle must be corrected to account for this systematic deviation.

When the cross-sections exhibit elliptical profiles with consistent major-axis orientations along the shaft, the component can be characterized as an elliptical cylinder. In such cases, rotational adjustment about the yaw axis is required. This adjustment ensures optimal alignment between the major axes of the shaft and hole ellipses.

The geometric data of both the shaft and hole were acquired using a coordinate measuring machine (CMM). Subsequent analysis revealed three key observations:

1. The shaft axis exhibited oscillatory deviations rather than unidirectional bending. The undulations were observed along the entire length of the shaft. 【图片-直线度】
    
2. The mean diameter remained nearly constant across all measured cross-sections. This consistency was maintained despite the observed axis deviations.
    
3. The cross-sectional profiles showed no elliptical characteristics. The radial variations did not follow a systematic two-lobe pattern typical of ovality. 【图片-圆】
    

These findings suggest that the observed cylindricity errors primarily stem from axis wandering rather than diameter variations or elliptical distortion.
two-point contact dominates in shaft-hole assemblies due to the limited clearance. Consequently, in rigid-body simulations, the contact positions are not significantly affected by minor cylindricity deviations.

The perfect cylindrical model effectively captures the geometric and force interactions during assembly. Therefore, it is adopted for rigid-body simulations. This simplification remains valid as long as the cylindricity errors do not alter the fundamental contact behavior.

#### 刚体Assumption
The upper base of the shaft and the lower base of the hole have been assumped to be rigid during the peg-in-hole process for simplification. We also simplify the shape of the shaft and hole as perfect cylinders. By further assump that the hole and the shaft as rigid bodies, we can confirm the position where the two-point contact locates, the position of contact points can be represent by insertion depth h and tilt angle theta and alpha. 根据轴对称, and utilize 2d simplification, we perform FEA for the shaft, the material of the shaft is 6061 alloy, the external force acts on the edge, and its direction point toward (x:1,y:-1)（换个表达）, its value is 2N. Shown in fig3.1, the max URES （说明这是距离） exist at the edge where the contact point locates, and it value is small, we can assume that the deformation is eligeble. Similarly, the cylinder shape of the hole is 忽略了。 We assume that both the shaft and hole holds perfect cylinder during the peg-in-hole progress.

For simplification, the upper base of the shaft and the lower base of the hole are assumed to be rigid during the peg-in-hole process. Additionally, the shapes of the shaft and hole are simplified as perfect cylinders.

By further assuming the hole and shaft as rigid bodies, the position of two-point contact can be determined. The contact points can be represented by the insertion depth (h) and tilt angles (θ and α). Due to axisymmetry, a 2D simplification is utilized.

Finite element analysis (FEA) is performed on the shaft, which is made of 6061 alloy. An external force of 2 N is applied at the edge, with a direction vector of (1, -1). As shown in Fig. 3.1, the maximum displacement (URES) occurs at the edge where the contact point is located. Since the value is small, the deformation is assumed to be negligible.

Similarly, the cylindrical shape of the hole is disregarded. Both the shaft and hole are assumed to maintain perfect cylindrical shapes throughout the peg-in-hole process.

#### 摩擦Columb Friction and Friction Cones of 2-points contact
由于刚体假设，当tilt angle过大时将进入wedging。由于使用了平面柔顺机构，当只有一点接触时候，hole会在平面上自由移动，随着shaft的下降，单点接触逐渐转变为2-points contact. 在2-point contact阶段，当tilt angle不足以形成几何卡死时，Virtual Simulation需要根据摩擦力判断shaft能够继续下降，或者进入了jamming.
	（几何卡死而非力卡死叫做wedging）
在我们的系统中，所有的insertion都是以10μm为单位步进的。对于我们的系统，为了确定friction cone以及判断force是否在friction cone内，需要知道铝合金6061的Coefficient of Friction. shaft下降的速度由导轨的驱动电机决定。xx提到，Coefficient of Friction在Initial stage时小于Stablized Stage，并且启动速度更大时Coefficient of Friction也更大。空气弹簧的Coefficient of Friction是不需要的，由于在2-point接触时候，shaft和hole的相对位移只在Z轴方向发生。Shaft和hole之间的接触压力F1由于tilt angle过小，可以假设为径向的。接触压力F1的产生，是由于电感测微仪的不均匀压缩导致了upper base of shaft的轻微tilt，以及弹簧的不均匀压缩导致了lower base of hole的轻微tilt，在前文已经提到这两个tilt非常小可以忽略。在Virtual Simulation中，压力将传递到连接在lower base底部的三个Z轴力传感器。
根据Friction Cones, 我们将在virtual Simulation中判断是否发生jamming.

Due to the rigid-body assumption, wedging occurs when the tilt angle exceeds a critical threshold 【引文1】. The planar compliant mechanism (the air bearing) is employed, allowing free planar motion of the hole under single-point contact. As the shaft descends, the contact transitions from single-point to two-point contact. During the two-point contact stage, virtual simulation determines whether the shaft can continue descending (i.e., continue inserting into the hole) or enters jamming, based on frictional analysis. This situation occurs exclusively when the tilt angle is insufficient for wedging. In this system, all insertions are splitted into 10[μm] steps.

To establish the friction cone and evaluate force conditions, the coefficient of friction (CoF) of aluminum alloy 6061 must be characterized. The shaft’s descent velocity is governed by the drive motor of the linear slider. xx's mentioned that the CoF during the initial stage is lower than in the stabilized stage, and higher actuation speeds correlate with increased CoF 【引文2】. The air spring’s CoF is negligible, as relative displacement between the shaft and hole occurs exclusively along the Z-axis during two-point contact.
The contact force [F1]​ is assumed to be radially oriented due to the minimal tilt angle. This force arises from:

1. Slight tilting of the shaft’s upper base caused by uneven compression of the inductive micrometer.
2. Slight tilting of the hole’s lower base caused by uneven spring compression.  
Both tilting have negligible effects on geometry of the system as previously noted. In virtual simulation, [F1] is transmitted to the three Z-axis force sensors mounted beneath the lower base.

Jamming is predicted in the virtual simulation through friction cone analysis.
