The small clearance between the shaft and hole necessitated carefully cocerns on geometry tolerances during geometric modeling. Cylindricity of the shaft attributes to three factors: the straightness of the shaft axis, radius variations along the axial direction, and radius variations at different polar angles.  

We particularly focused to whether the radius variations exhibited preferential deformation directions, that is, if the cross-sectional profile approximated an elliptical shape.

If the center offset accumulates consistently in one direction, indicating an inclined axis, angular compensation becomes necessary during alignment procedures. The offset angle must be corrected to account for this systematic deviation.

When the cross-sections exhibit elliptical profiles with consistent major-axis orientations along the shaft, the component can be characterized as an elliptical cylinder. In such cases, rotational adjustment about the yaw axis is required. This adjustment ensures optimal alignment between the major axes of the shaft and hole ellipses.

The geometric data of both the shaft and hole were acquired using a coordinate measuring machine (CMM). Subsequent analysis revealed three key observations:

1. The shaft axis exhibited oscillatory deviations rather than unidirectional bending. The undulations were observed along the entire length of the shaft. 【图片-直线度】
    
2. The mean diameter remained nearly constant across all measured cross-sections. This consistency was maintained despite the observed axis deviations.
    
3. The cross-sectional profiles showed no elliptical characteristics. The radial variations did not follow a systematic two-lobe pattern typical of ovality. 【图片-圆】
    

These findings suggest that the observed cylindricity errors primarily stem from axis wandering rather than diameter variations or elliptical distortion.
two-point contact dominates in shaft-hole assemblies due to the limited clearance. Consequently, in rigid-body simulations, the contact positions are not significantly affected by minor cylindricity deviations.

The perfect cylindrical model effectively captures the geometric and force interactions during assembly. Therefore, it is adopted for rigid-body simulations. This simplification remains valid as long as the cylindricity errors do not alter the fundamental contact behavior.
