一共20000pairs虚拟数据被用于训练神经网络。这些数据通过模拟产生，具有固定的初始条件2-point contact occurs, 其initial插入深度由随机生成的clearance (5~20 um)和tilt angle (theta phi)决定，经过6步后产生6组数据。神经网络包括两层卷积层，一层池化层，两层全连接层，输出到6个通道。分别是theta>0 theta<0 phi>0 phi<0 stuck none. 其中none是神经网络在其他结果都不具有可能性时的输出。此时的神经网络结果置信度较低，因此使用k-NN classifier将相邻的6组结果整合，根据其一致性与current难度区间判据的输出结果，决定最终的神经网络输出结果。
20,000 pairs of virtual data were generated through simulation for training the neural network. These data pairs possess fixed initial conditions where two-point contact occurs. The initial insertion depth is determined by randomly generated clearance (ranging from 5~20 \micrometers) and tilt angles (theta and phi). Each simulation generates six sets of data over six steps, resulting in a 6to6 matrix as input in each data pairs.
The neural network comprises 2 convolutional layers (kernel size = 3, input channel number = 1), 1 pooling layer (kernel size = 2, stride = 2), and 2 fully connected layers, with its output directed to six channels. The probability distribution over six distinct states is provided. These channels correspond to distinct states: theta > 0, theta < 0, phi > 0, phi < 0, stuck, and none. The "none" channel represents the neural network's output when no other outcomes exhibit sufficient probability. In instances where the "none" output occurs, the confidence level of the neural network's result is considered low. Consequently, a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier is employed to integrate six adjacent sets of results. The final neural network output is then determined based on the consistency of these integrated results and their comparison with the output of the difficulty criteria.
