虽然; however,也可用。Traditionally等用在句首
Traditionally, it was assumed that workers achieved peak productivity with a five-day weeks and eight-hour day.
it was assumed that, is即某个“假设”整体被assumed
workers can have.. =>workers achieved.. and eight-hour days.：完整的“假设”语法和主、动、客不一样。
一定用and连接，而不是, 因为这是with后的完整“表述”

以前的，使用Traditionally, Conventionally代替Previously
