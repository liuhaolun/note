Let's consider one thing: how freetalk is extended and stretched-out from simple ideas?
I got 2 ideas for a topic usually.
	"should children do household task as soon as they are old enough to do so."
		skill early
		part family
	skill early kinda easy to built with experience. "After I attended my undergraduate program"
	part family is sth. purely theoretical
