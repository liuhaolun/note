### Abstract
Throughout the 20th century, typewriters played a pivotal role in typography and industrial publishing, offering standardized character formation that significantly improved the quality of printing and significantly impacted the printing industry. This thesis examines the historical development of Chinese typewriters, analyzing the limitations of different designs and proposing a novel dot-matrix typewriter design. The dot-matrix typewriter may not be suitable for industrial printing applications; however, its cost-effectiveness makes it ideal for personal writings. Further, the configuration of the dot-matrix typewriter can be adapted for producing affordable Braille displays, maintaining its relevance in contemporary applications.

### Intro
First patent of typewriter was granted in 1714; however, it was not until 1868 that the typewriter suitable for mass production was invented. The earliest attempts at Chinese typewriters can be traced back to the early 20th century, with the emergence of 'direct indexing' typewriters. Further developments involve the introduction of retrieval systems and division and decomposition approaches.
#### Direct-indexing
/ 字形 glyph
Direct-indexing typewriters are defined as an apparatus with a operational platform arranged with lead character blocks that are either movable or fixed, the shape of the platform can be circular or square. Devello Z. Sheffield pioneered a typewriter with circular platform, where fixed lead blocks were installed, the platform and the paper are both movable, a mechanical structure was designed for pressing a specific lead block onto the paper, printing the glyph onto the paper. A more practical iteration was developed by Zhou Houkun, he replaced the circular platform with a square one and fixed lead blocks with movable ones, a mechanical structure was designed for grabbing up the movable lead blocks. Subsequently, this design was enhanced by Shu Zhendong, Shu's typewriter has a main advantage that it introduced complementary black-on-white index sheets, eliminating the need for typist to recognize mirrored glyph. Further, Japanese manufacturers introduced an innovative drum-shaped design, featuring lead blocks arranged on a cylindrical surface of the drum. While this compact design approached the size of Western typewriters, it's prohibitively high cost prevented it from it initial purposes for domestic applications. The complexity of these machines, especially for the amount of movable lead blocks, exemplified by the Double Dove DHY-d model with its 2,450 lead types, resulted in prohibitively high production costs. Moreover, typist has to master complex technique to operate the typewriter. These attributes contributed to the result that direct-indexing typewriters had a limited applications in industrial printing.

The earliest Chinese character retrieval system can be tracked back to 1912, when Gao Mengdan brought out “Merged Radicals Method (归并部首法)”; however, the first retrieval system designed for input was invented by Ling Yutang in his MingKwai typewriter.

##### division form
 Typewriter systems mentioned previously shared a fundamental characteristic that is the capability for definitioning and customization of font. While relaxing typographical constraints would render further systems less suitable for industrial printing applications, this compromise enabled greater design flexibility and more possibilities. In the conceptual framework of dot-matrix and bar-based typewriters, character glyph relied solely on fundamental elements—either dots or linear bars—which, through strategic combination, defined the final typeface glyph.
