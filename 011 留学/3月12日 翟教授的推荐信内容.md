Dear Admissions Committee at \[学校名称],

I am pleased to recommend Mr. Liu Haolun for admission to the [项目名称] at [学校名称]. Throughout his academic career, Haolun has exhibited [换一个比exceptional低程度的形容词] intellectual curiosity, particularly in the field of [轴承相关技术名词]. His persistent self-motivation underscores his potential for continued academic and professional development.
In my course, [课程名称], Haolun distinguished himself through proactive engagement and analytical contributions. 
A notable example was his detailed geometric explanation of the sidewall etch angle, which was presented during a discussion on silicon wet etching. -> 他积极参与了研究生的romax spin的软件培训，并且在自己的研究小组内分享了他对于磁悬浮轴承的仿真的看法
	He proactively participated in the graduate-level Romax Spin software training program, and shared his insights on the simulation of active magnetic bearings within his research team.
During the self-assembly module, his frequent inquiries reflected a commitment to understanding underlying principles rather than accepting superficial explanations. -> 在结课作业中，他根据力锤实验结果，分析了金属件形状如何影响振型的几个特性
	In experiment report, based on modal test result, analyzed several features on how model shape can affect vibration shape.
		In his final course project, based on impact hammer testing results, he identified several patterns governing how the distribution of bolted joints significantly induces localized bending modes and shifts in harmonic orders.

Rather than pursuing a broad range of topics, Haolun demonstrates a targeted curiosity, channelling his interest toward the mathematical mechanics of phenomena and how they translate into practical, real-world applications.
For instance, drawing on his understanding of sheet resistance measurement, he proposed an alternative probe design that grounded in an equation-driven framework. -> 他观察到一半螺栓和安装全部螺栓，法兰的敲击振型不同，提出可以不考虑对称地总是只安装奇数个螺丝，以减少振动对系统的影响。
	For instance, drawing on his insights on the differences between mode shapes when half or all bolts are installed, he proposed that by install only odd numbers of bolt, we can limit vibration's negative effect on system.
		For instance, drawing on his observation of variations in mode shapes between half-bolted and fully-bolted configuration, he proposed a novel strategy to mitigate disturbances in the system by asymmetrical install odd-numbered bolts.
			For instance, drawing on his observations of modal shape variations between half-bolted and fully-bolted configurations during, he proposed a novel vibration mitigation strategy through asymmetrical installation of odd-numbered bolt patterns.
He pairs open, creative thinking with a principled approach, generating feasible solutions that mark him as a thinker of actionable ideas.

In conclusion, I strongly recommend Haolun for your MSc program.
With his open-minded approach and enthusiasm for engaging meaningfully in academic discourse, Haolun embodies the qualities that make him a highly suitable candidate who will thrive at [学校名称]. Please do not hesitate to contact me for additional information regarding his application.

Sincerely,
Jingyu Zhai
