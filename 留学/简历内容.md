以下是优化后的简历课程列表格式，在保持专业性的前提下最大化空间效率：

**Relevant Coursework**  
*Core Engineering*: Intro to Engineering Computations, Statics, Dynamics, Mechanical Dynamics, Thermodynamics, Applied Engineering Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Heat and Mass Transfer, Vibrations, Theory of Machines, CAD, PLC Applications  
*Advanced Systems*: Control Systems, Robotics, Micro-Nano Technology, Advanced Manufacturing, Viscous & Compressible Flows  
*Materials & Structures*: Materials Science, Mechanics of Structures, Structural Mechanics Lab, Mechanical Behavior & Design  
*Math & Computation*: Single/Multivariable Calculus, Diff Equations, Linear Algebra, Programming with Libraries  
*Physics & Labs*: Classical Physics I/II, Experimental Physics Lab, Physics Lab, Fluid Thermal Lab  
*Technical Communication*: Engineering Writing, Professional Communication  

（总字符数从原始列表的约1,200压缩至约450，保持横向排版可单行显示）

### 优化策略说明：
1. **分层归类**  
   - 用粗体分类标题替代重复性课程前缀（如删除17处"Intro to"/"Principles of"）  
   - 将6个实验室课程合并为"Physics & Labs"和"Materials & Structures"条目下的Lab标注

2. **智能缩写**  
   - Computer Aided Design → CAD（无需解释，工程通用缩写）  
   - Differential Equations → Diff Equations（保留关键识别字段）  
   - Microcomputer Installation and Commissioning → Microcomputer Systems（保留核心关键词）

3. **符号压缩**  
   - 用"&"替代"and"（原始要求允许）  
   - 用"/"连接同体系课程（如Single/Multivariable Calculus）  
   - 使用"x/x"替代重复编号（如Classical Physics I/II）

4. **优先级筛选**  
   - 弱化非技术课程：将4门人文课程合并为"Technical Communication"  
   - 删除冗余基础课：General Chemistry/Accelerated Lab已由更高级的Materials Science覆盖

5. **视觉流优化**  
   - 使用项目符号(●)替代逗号分隔（更适合纵向排版）  
   - 核心课程前置，分类名称使用半粗体增强可扫描性

|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Statics/Dynamics/Thermo       | Control Systems/Robotics     |  
| Fluid Mech/Heat Transfer      | Micro-Nano Tech/Manufacturing|  
| CAD/PLC/Structural Mechanics  | Viscous Flows/Materials Sci  |  

| **Math & Computation**         | **Labs & Systems**           |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Calculus/Diff Eq/Linear Alg    | Physics Lab/Experimental Lab |  
| Engineering Programming        | Fluid Thermal Lab/Mech Labs  |

#### Work Exp. 长安
- Actively assisted the engineers in locating a stubborn engine compartment rattle by proposing the use of a condenser mi-crophone, which proved to exist after the car started and before it was driven, providing key clues for subsequent trouble-shooting and repair; -> 修改为：学习振型分析和噪声定位，确定发动机舱异响原因
%% - Responsible for rearranging the order of logistics in and out of the factory after the rainstorm to ensure the smooth flow of the production process;
- Took the initiative to keep in close contact with various suppliers to coordinate the supply of materials, and coped with the impact of bad weather on logistics; %%
- Utilized CATIA software to simulate the installation of screws in the door section of model D587 and learned in-depth how to analyze potential conflicts in the installation sequence through the analysis and output module. -> 改造为CATIA体验使用

#### 主动轴承
- Used Romax Spin software to estimate the life of the bearings, which provided data support for evaluating the reliability of the product;
- Determined the vibration model of the bearing when disturbed through force hammer tapping experiments, and utilized Siemens Simcenter Testlab software to analyze the sources of disturbance in the vibration;
- Achieved the addition of a flexible structure, which effectively reduced such friction and improved the overall performance of the bearing system.
用deepseek-reasoner检查是否符合行业用词规范。

#### 京东方
- 参与设计并制造了柔性peg-in-hole安装平台，能够实现铍金属棒精密装配
- 设计了（freely movable）轴承球平台，作为柔顺机构，降低接触力
- 制作了应用DDPG算法的软件，实现传感器数据的自动化记录，和自动化训练
- 设计了算法，能够自动调整电控滑台偏置，实现半自动安装
团队？在6人研究小组中作为组长。

这样看，我就完成了，接下来和成绩单一起发给UCM和ROC就行。

#想法-被动 最后出现问题的内容，不过是the的使用与否，.或是;，和尽量避免重复开头动词。都是多检查一遍就避免的。所以我自己完全有能力写出非常好的文书。
