Dear Haolun,

Greetings! As you navigate the next steps in the enrollment process, we wanted to check in to see if you have any questions.   
  
As you prepare to arrive on campus, we will again refer you to the Enrollment and Visa Checklists on your [applicant status page](https://mx.technolutions.net/ss/c/u001.iHvmj6LPp6heKAnFZ70rQxUukFPzYr4HFVDmccuj664_NvncgWEcBwppoXiwx2gp/4ga/f830YvzIQkivmJpwqCqE_Q/h0/h001.xJf1lJiCqn9AC1Th_g9nV6EsKlIU_h_T1NJEzlujb4o "http://apply.rpi.edu/apply/status").   
  
As a reminder, official transcripts and diplomas from outside of the US need to be brought with you to campus. We will be reviewing these documents during International Student Orientation.  
  
Visa documents can be uploaded using your [applicant status page](https://mx.technolutions.net/ss/c/u001.iHvmj6LPp6heKAnFZ70rQxUukFPzYr4HFVDmccuj664_NvncgWEcBwppoXiwx2gp/4ga/f830YvzIQkivmJpwqCqE_Q/h1/h001.-2hL7W0OTNgpphHa5ExzVc9knFqbq93VeyIw7vZM-1I "http://apply.rpi.edu/apply/status"). All visa related questions can be directed to [i20grad@rpi.edu](mailto:i20grad@rpi.edu "mailto:i20grad@rpi.edu").

If you have questions regarding the specific documents required from you, please feel free to contact us at [gradops@rpi.edu](mailto:gradops@rpi.edu "mailto:gradops@rpi.edu").   
  
Sincerely,

在apply.rpi.edu/apply/status页面存在Visa tab要求上传三种文件：
- Copy of Passport
- Sponsor Letter （从链接中下载pdf，打印签名后扫描）[[plus/Affidavit of Support.pdf]]
- Proof of Funding - Self

应该多看gradadmissions.rpi.edu/accepted-students介绍了所有应该关注的。
